## Overview

A tool for identifying, understanding, and engaging with one's emotions. Based on ideas from [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy).

## Why Build This

Through therapy I've learned that there are diminishing returns to logical thinking alone. Although analyzing a problem in terms of pros and cons of various solutions can be useful, there are times when analysis drives itself into an endless loop, leading to indecision and frustration. Even when a problem is more clear cut, a solution that omits the emotional component can feel unsatsifying and inconclusive. In either case, therefore, it is useful to have a framework for interacting with one's emotions. 

The framework built into this app was learned through a combination of therapy and by using Gillian Butler's book [Overcoming Social Anxiety and Shyness](https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Shyness-2nd/dp/1472120434) (which I highly recommended if you struggle with either of those problems). It involves shifting towards an attitude of curiosity about what emotions you're currently experiencing, examining the reasons you believe you're feeling those emotions, and questioning or challenging those reasons if you determine that you'd be better served changing them. 

Although nothing is strictly required to carry out these steps, I've found that they're substantially more impactful if done in writing. And although writing can be done with only pen and paper, I've found that carrying the process out without any additional structure beyond that can be surprisingly tricky. This is because you need to manage several things at once (feeling your emotions, explicating them, repeating the process for however many emotions are at play, keeping yourself in a mode of emotional reasoning, etc.). Hence the usefulness of this app: it aims to remove some of the metacognitive burden of this process, so that there can be greater focus on the core emotions and thinking patterns at play.

## How Does It Work

TODO Add flowchart

## Installing and Running

```
python index.py
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Create core flow for analyzing a single emotion
- [x] Allow analyzing multiple emotions in a single session
- [ ] Pretty print session on exit

### Ideas for Future Iterations

- [ ] Persist data across sessions
- [ ] Identify counterproductive language. For example: pressurized words like "should" and "must"
- [ ] Support returning to certain topics and situations based on past sessions

## Additional Resources 

### The Feeling Wheel

When I first began using this methodology, I was surprised at how difficult I found it to place names on my feelings. Although I didn't lack the vocabulary per se, I did find it hard to connect it to my experience in the moment. What helped substantially was using a a [feeling wheel](https://feelingswheel.com/). 

To use it, identify which of the course-grained emotions at the center of the wheel you're experiencing and work outward to put a finer point on your experience. With time, you'll likely find you don't need this reference, although it is always useful to have in your proverbial toolbelt. 

### Other Mental Health Services

Although the framework built into this app has become an indispensible tool for me, what was ultimately most impactful to my mental health was working directly with a professional. If you are curious about mental health services, here are some resources I hope can help get you started:
