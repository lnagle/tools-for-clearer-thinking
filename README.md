# tools-for-clearer-thinking

A suite of tools for thinking more deliberately and rigorously through a variety of common problems.

## Tools

1. Emotional Reasoning: A tool for identifying, understanding, and engaging with one's emotions. Based on ideas from [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy).
2. Art Analysis: A tool for analyzing a piece of art, starting with the most simple descriptive elements and building to complex commentary.
3. Recursive Learning: A tool for testing one's knowledge, solidifying learnings, and uncovering areas that lack clarity in one's thinking.

## Goals

1. Build various 'Algorithms of Thought' into a simple and straightfoward applications.
2. Abstract away some amount of the [metacognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition) burden of thinking about complex topics.

## Anti-Goals

1. Build a complex UI. Because most of the work that this project seeks to facilitate happens between your ears, there should not be a need for a complicated UI. For as long as is reasonable, these projects will remain CLIs.
2. Complexify the algorithms. At least initially, these projects should be deceptively simple. There are great benefits to having even relatively straightforward lines of thought carried through to their logical endpoint, and so bells and whistles beyond that should be minimized. Over time, it's likely that the logic of these tools will become more branched and nuanced, but those changes should arise naturally via direct usage of the tools themselves.
